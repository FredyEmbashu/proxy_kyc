# AI-Enhanced KYC System for Namibian Microlenders

## Research Overview
This project is part of a Master's thesis research at Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST) by Fredy Lineekela Embashu, focusing on developing an AI-enhanced Know Your Customer (KYC) system specifically designed for Namibian microlenders.

### Research Objectives
1. To develop an efficient and accurate KYC verification system using AI technologies
2. To reduce verification time and costs for microlenders
3. To improve accessibility to financial services in Namibia
4. To ensure compliance with local regulations while maintaining user privacy
